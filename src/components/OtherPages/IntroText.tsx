          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) infections encompass a group of
            illnesses that affect multiple organ systems and induce vascular
            damage as well as impaired homeostatic regulation. VHFs can be
            asymptomatic, but they can also induce high rates of mortality.
            Unfortunately, the host response mechanisms that determine the
            pathogenicity, morbidity and mortality of VHFs are poorly understood.

            HotRes Database aims to provide centralized access to gene expression
            data sets from studies of Ebola virus, Marburg virus and Lassa virus
            infections in non-human primates. These studies were conducted at the
            US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID),
            Integrated Research Facilities (IRF) in Fredrick, MD or IRF at the
            Rocky Mountain Labs (RML). These studies were analyzed at the Connor
            laboratory at Boston University Medical Center and should aid in the
            generation of hypotheses and the elucidation of VHF host response
            mechanisms. Please read more about the Connor lab{" "}
