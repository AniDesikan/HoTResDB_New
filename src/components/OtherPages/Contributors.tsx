      <p>
        HoTRes Database was developed by Jonathan Lo, Jose Negron, and Deric
        Zhang at Boston University in partial fulfillment of the requirements
        for BF768 Biological Database Analysis (Spring 2016) under the
        instruction of Dr. G. Benson. Further advising was provided by Dr. John
        Connor and Dr. Emily Speranza at BUMC. It was later updated by Nicholas
        O'Neill, Boting Ning, Jamie Strampe, and Jeffrey Maurer for the same
        course (Spring 2018), with help from Dr. G. Benson and Dr. Connor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The database was further modified by Anirudh Desikan, Shripushkar Ganesh
        Krishnan, Haochun Huang, and Liyuan Hu at Boston University in partial
        fulfillment of the requirements for BF768 Biological Database Analysis
        (Spring 2024) under the instruction of Dr. G. Benson. Further advising
        was provided by Dr. John Connor at BUMC.
